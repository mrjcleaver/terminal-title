Xtitle is a relatively simple shell script program that, when run in an
xterm or xterm-like window, will set the window's title and/or icon name
to the script's arguments.  See the included man page for full details.

Normally, I wouldn't think of packaging and distributing a tool this
straightforward, but it snuck out into general usage anyway (thanks to
the search engines, I suppose) and was well received.  So here it is
with a man page, Imakefile and all.

----------------------------  INSTALLATION  ----------------------------

Xtitle may be installed either as a regular X11 program or manually in
any desired locations, including your home directory.

A)  AS AN X11 PROGRAM

    The usual routine

	xmkmf
	make install
	make install.man
	make clean

    should properly install the xtitle script in your X11 bin directory
    and the man page file in your X11 man directory.

B)  MANUALLY

    You can copy the "xtitle.sh" file here into any directory in your
    PATH, probably named just "xtitle" then.  Make sure the copy's made
    executable.  The "xtitle.man" and/or "xtitle.html" man pages can be
    installed as/where you desire.
